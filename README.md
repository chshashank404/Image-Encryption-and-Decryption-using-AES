# Image Encryption and Decryption using AES

A Python GUI application to encrypt and decrypt images using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. This tool allows users to securely encrypt image files and decrypt them back to their original form using a secret key.

## Features

- **Image Encryption:** Securely encrypt images with a key of up to 32 bytes.
- **Image Decryption:** Decrypt the encrypted images back to their original state.
- **User-friendly GUI:** Easy to use graphical interface built with `tkinter`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library for image handling.
- `PyCryptodome` library for AES encryption and decryption.
- `numpy` library for array manipulation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-decryption-aes.git
   cd image-encryption-decryption-aes
